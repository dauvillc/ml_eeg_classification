# Covert speech decoding from EEG signals
## Repo organization
* data: contains the raw data provided by the lab. This normally includes the folders 'clean_data_sub_01', 
  and 'Data_ML_Internship'. However the data is confidential. For this reason, we were only in measure of providing
  the 'ready-to-use' data which we have extracted ourselves. Therefore the data folder is present but empty.
* data_loading: python local package to extract and load the data.

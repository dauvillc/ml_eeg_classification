Report here the best conditions for all models
Be as precise as possible to make the results fully reproducible
Try to ALWAYS USE random_state = 42 whenever possible

types of inputs:
abs(rfft(epochs)): Module of the real FFT of the channels
    nb_features = nb_channels x nb_timesteps // 2


types of scalings:
    minmax: x = (x - x.min) / (x.max - x.min)
    normalization = (x - x.mean) / x.std


Linear Regression:
Input = abs(rfft(epochs))
Scaling = minmax
Best frequency band = High gamma
L2 penalty with C = 10.0 to 25.0, solver lbfgs
mean acc = 0.7214, std=0.1222
--Same results for--
Scaling = normalization
L2 penalty with C = 0.005, solver lbfgs, 200 max iterations
mean acc = 0.7214, std=0.1222
--Same results for--
Frequency band = Low gamma
Scaling = norm
L2 penalty with C = 0.01, solver lbfgs, 200 max it
mean acc = 0.7214, std=0.1222

Random Forest:
Input = abs(rfft(epochs))
Best freq band = all
n_estimators = 300, max_depth = 3
DAY 4:
mean test acc = 0.8500, std=0.1090
--> Leave-one-out cross-valid: 0.8608, std=0.3462
-- OR --:
Input = abs(rfft(epochs))
freq band = all
n_estimators = 300, max depth = 3
ELECTRODES = right temporal
scaling = normalization or minmax or none
DAY 4:
mean test acc = 0.8875, std=0.1526
--> Leave-one-out cross-valid: 0.8734, std=0.3325
-- OR --:
Input = abs(rfft(epochs))
freq band = all
n_estimators = 300, max depth = 1
ELECTRODES = right temporal
scaling = normalization or minmax
TIME WINDOW = 0s to 4s
DAY 4:
mean test acc = 0.9000, std=0.1837
---> Leave-one-out cross-valid: 0.8861, std=0.3177
